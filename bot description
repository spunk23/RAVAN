Description :
● RAVAN is a 15 kg robowar bot, made using aluminium sheets along with a steel roller which can go upto a speed of 14000 rpm.
● The cuboidal structure of RAVAN makes it well balanced and the steel frame makes it highly sustainable against opponent’s attacks.
● We control our bot using the FS CT6B transmitter which sends commands to the receiver.
● The receiver further sends the commands to the arduino which controls the motor using motordriver.
● Roller is controlled using 50A esc that interprets signal from receiver.
